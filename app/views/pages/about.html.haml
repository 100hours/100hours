        The following information applies to <em>100 Hours of Solitude</em>, the original writing
        project that took place on this site in 2012.

    %h2 What's this all about?

    %p
      My name’s David Varela and I’m a writer.
      I’ve written films, plays, games, poems, global ad campaigns, and all sorts of other strange things – but now, for one week only, I’m taking requests.
      I’ll write what you tell me to. 
      You can also watch my writing process in action – live, via webcam – and you’ll be able to see every keystroke as I type it on our website. 
      For 100 hours, my every word is yours.
      I’m taking a vow of silence and I won’t have any private communications – no texts, no tweets, no emails.
      Every word is public domain. And everything I write is copyright-free.

    %h2 What’s the good cause?
    %p
      All this is to raise money for Arvon, who run residential creative writing weeks for schools and community groups and are building a collaborative writing platform for young people.
      You can see their work at
      %a{href: "http://arvonfoundation.org/"}http://arvonfoundation.org/

    %h2 How exactly does it work?
    %p
      Click the ‘Donate’ button, which will take you off to the
      %a{href: "http://www.justgiving.com/100hoursofsolitude"}JustGiving
      website, where you can donate money and leave me a note saying what you’d like me to write. 
      I’m open to suggestions – make me an offer!

    %h2 Where and when?

    %p
      I’ll be at Arvon’s writing centre in Lumb Bank – former home of Ted Hughes, just down the road from Sylvia Plath’s final resting place.
      It’s an isolated farmhouse in Yorkshire, and when I’m up there (December 17th-22nd) it’s going to be cold and probably snowbound. 
      It’s very likely that this whole thing will turn into an online recreation of The Shining.

    %h2 Is there anything you won’t write?
    %p
      As this is raising money for children’s writing development and literacy, I’m steering away from anything entirely depraved. 
      No porn. Sorry. 
      Also, I can’t write anything that will violate someone else’s copyright, so don’t ask me to type out War and Peace. 
      Oh, and nothing libellous. That would be bad.

    %h2 What if you have too many requests?
    %p
      It would be a nice problem to have.
      I’m not planning to sleep much so I should be able to get through a lot of writing.
      If I do end up having to choose which requests to fulfil, priority will go to those who have made the largest donations – so be generous.

    %h2 Will you write my company’s transmedia strategy?
    %p
      In a word, yes.
      However, expect to pay the kind of rate you’d be charged by a business consultant.
      Just because this is for charity doesn’t mean you can get a cheap deal.
      And bear in mind that everything I write will be public, so non-disclosure agreements will be tricky.

    %h2 What’s this ‘copyright-free’ malarkey?
    %p
      Everything I write in this week will be released under a CC Zero licence.
      That means you can all copy it, remix it, and do whatever you like with it, and you won’t even need to credit me.
      I’m a firm believer in Creative Commons, so I’m putting it into action here.
      I’m also really hoping I don’t come up with a million-dollar idea this week by accident.

    %h2 Do we get to see you naked?
    %p
      No. There is a webcam, but it’s not in the bathroom.
      You might get some hot dressing gown action though.

    %h2 Who built this amazing website?
    %p
      This technical marvel was created by 
      %a{href: "http://twitter.com/alexheeton"}Alex Heeton 
      and 
      %a{href: "http://twitter.com/bru"}Riccardo Cambiassi
      – who offered their services entirely free of charge.
      If you ever see them, buy them a drink. 
    %p

      %a{href: "http://ustream.tv"}Ustream
