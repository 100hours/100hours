        My nameâ€™s David Varela, and I've foolishly volunteered to write whatever you want, live, on webcam, with every keystroke seen as it is made, while taking a vow of silence for 100 hours in Ted Hughes' old Yorkshire farmhouse. It's all to raise money for Arvon's work with children's literacy and writing projects.
      %p
        If I get enough work to keep me busy for the whole 100 hours, I probably won't sleep - which should be very entertaining for everyone.
      %p
        The 100 hours start at midnight GMT on Monday December 17th and run through to 4am on December 22nd.
