        My nameâ€™s David Varela, and I've foolishly volunteered to write whatever you want, live, on webcam, with every keystroke seen as it is made, while taking a vow of silence for 100 hours in Ted Hughes' old Yorkshire farmhouse. Every word I write will be released for free under a CC0 licence. It's all to raise money for Arvon's work with children's literacy and writing projects. 
      %p 
        If I get enough work to keep me busy for the whole 100 hours, I probably won't sleep - which should be very entertaining for everyone.

      %p.test
        The actual 100 hours will start on December 17th and run through to December 22nd. This here, today, is a test.
